With this plugin one can use short codes to hide/show a block of codes depending on whether or not a user belongs to a LinkedIn group. This requires users to authenticate using LinkedIn. 

== Description ==
This plugin serves a very specific purpose. I needed a way to show/hide blocks of codes in my posts for uses who belonged to a specific LinkedIn group. Use of this plugin requires that you create a LinkedIn API key and secret. This can be done at https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer?newapp=

Drop it in the wp-content/plugins folder and unzip the plugin.
Create your LinkedIn application API key and secret at https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer?newapp=
Plug in the API key and secret in the plugin\'s options page.
